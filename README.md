SuperGlue is a spigot-plugin library built in Kotlin designed to give you the best experience developing a range of different features, 
including general extensions, GUIs, custom items & blocks and of course, commands, using a small wrapper around the [Lamp](https://github.com/Revxrsal/Lamp) command framework.

You can import the plugin via Jitpack using the following in your build.gradle

```kt
repositories {
    maven("https://www.jitpack.io")
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.SuperGlueLib:SuperGlue:1.0.0")
}
```

You should replace the version "1.0.0" with the [latest version](https://github.com/SuperGlueLib/SuperGlue/releases/latest) of the library.
